# Changelog

All notable changes to the YouTube Videos Component for Joomla will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.0.40] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **Structured Data Validation:** Fixed a "mutually exclusive" error in the `ListItem` schema by moving the `url` property inside the `item` (VideoObject) instead of having it on the `ListItem` itself.

## [1.0.39] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **Structured Data Fallback:** Switched from null coalescing (`??`) to Elvis operator (`?:`) for thumbnail fallback logic to ensure empty strings in the database correctly trigger the YouTube fallback.
- **Video View Bug Fix:** Fixed a logic error in the single video view where it was missing a guard clause and using an incorrect property for interaction statistics.

## [1.0.38] - 2026-01-01

### Fixed
- **JavaScript Versioning:** Explicitly included minified version of the YouTube player script to ensure updates are applied on production sites that load `.min.js` files by default.

## [1.0.35] - 2025-12-29

### Fixed
- **Video Import:** Fixed "Unknown column 'recipe_type' in 'field list'" error during video import.

## [1.0.34] - 2025-12-23

### Fixed
- **Module Title Parameter:** Renamed `show_title` parameter to `show_video_title` in both `mod_youtube_single` and `mod_youtubevideos` to avoid collision with Joomla's core module title parameter.

- Videos list now properly respects pagination settings and displays only the configured number of videos per page

- Default list limit is set to 4th multiple (e.g., 12 for 3 per row, 16 for 4 per row)

## [1.0.11] - 2024-11-06

### Fixed
- Category changes on videos now save correctly - the `category_id` field properly updates when changed or cleared

### Technical

### Fixed
- Batch controller no longer calls the deprecated `getBootableContainer()` method, preventing fatal errors on Joomla 5

- Changed from `popupButton()` to `standardButton()` with proper Bootstrap modal trigger

### Technical

## [1.0.6] - 2024-11-06

### Security
- **OAuth Scope Restriction:** Changed OAuth scope from `youtube.force-ssl` back to `youtube.readonly` following the principle of least privilege
- The component only performs read operations on YouTube API (fetching videos, channels, and playlists), so write permissions are unnecessary

### Technical
- Updated OAuth authorization scope in `OauthController.php` to use readonly permissions
- This reduces security risk by limiting the permissions granted to the application

## [1.0.5] - 2024-11-06

### Fixed

- Potential duplicate video entries during sync from paginated API responses

### Technical
- Added `pageToken` parameter to all YouTube API fetch methods
- Implemented `do-while` pagination loop in `syncVideos()` method

## Migration Notes

### From 1.0.0 to 1.0.3
1. **Check for Duplicates (Optional but Recommended)**:
   - Before updating, run the `cleanup_duplicates.php` script to check for duplicate video entries
   - Upload the script to your Joomla root directory
   - Run via CLI: `php cleanup_duplicates.php` or access via browser (Super User only)
   - The script runs in DRY RUN mode by default (safe, no changes)
   - If duplicates are found, backup your database and run with `$dryRun = false`

2. **Update Component**:
   - Install the new version via Joomla's Extension Manager
   - The database migration (1.0.3.sql) will run automatically
   - This adds a unique constraint on `youtube_video_id` to prevent future duplicates

3. **Verify Sync**:
   - After updating, run the video sync from the dashboard
   - You should now see all videos synced with detailed breakdown
   - Check the sync message for published/unpublished counts

4. **Security**:
   - Delete `cleanup_duplicates.php` after use for security

### From No Previous Version
This is the initial release. Follow the installation instructions in README.md
